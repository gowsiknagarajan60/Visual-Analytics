# **Open-Ended Experiment 2: Geospatial Storytelling with Plotly or Tableau**

## **Title:**  
**Visualizing the World: Geospatial Insights from a Global Dataset**

## **Objective:**  
Students will build a geospatial dashboard or visual story using Plotly or Tableau to illustrate a global trend, comparison, or issue.

## **Task:**  
- Select a dataset with geospatial information (e.g., global population, COVID-19 cases, renewable energy usage, etc.).  
- Design at least two different types of map visualizations (e.g., choropleth + bubble map).  
- Integrate filters or sliders to make it interactive (e.g., year, region).  
- Provide a visual story or dashboard that narrates the insight.

## **Expected Outcome:**  
An interactive report or dashboard published/shared via Tableau Public or a Plotly HTML file.

## **Skills Developed:**  
- Geospatial thinking, dashboard design, interactive UI development, data storytelling.




# **Open-Ended Experiment 4: Visualization Redesign Challenge**

## **Title:**  
**Redesign a Poor Visualization to Improve Clarity and Communication**

## **Objective:**  
Students will analyze a poor or misleading chart (from a report, newspaper, blog, or social media), critique its weaknesses, and redesign it using Seaborn, Matplotlib, or Power BI/Tableau.

## **Task:**  
- Find or choose a bad data visualization (can be misleading axes, wrong chart type, poor color usage, cluttered info, etc.).  
- Explain the issues in the original chart.  
- Redesign the visualization for clarity, accuracy, and aesthetics.  
- Present a before-and-after comparison with explanation.

## **Expected Outcome:**  
A mini-report or presentation showing:  
- Original visualization  
- Redesigned version  
- Justification of improvements

## **Skills Developed:**  
- Visual literacy, critical thinking, design aesthetics, ethical data presentation
